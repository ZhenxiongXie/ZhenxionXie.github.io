## RESEARCH PROJECTS

---

Strongly Correlated Electron Systems Sept. 2016-Jun. 2019  
Supervisor: Prof. Dao-Xin Yao (Sun Yat-sen University)  
Project: Random phase approximation to calculate susceptibility and gap of superconductors
* Reviewed random phase approximation and many other condensed matter theories such as high-temperature superconductors theory. 
* Some results are post on American Association of Physics Teachers 2017 Summer Meeting. 
* Computed the susceptibility of two-orbital iron-base superconductors and analyzed the gap by using BCS theory.  

Project: Modified spin-wave theory of CeFe_2 Al_10. 
- CeFe_2 Al_10 is still disordered when the temperature drops to below 50 mK. A modified spin-wave theory is able to explain the magnetic dynamic of this system, which cannot be described by the Heisenberg Model. 
- The Hamiltonian of the four-lattice model was proved; then, the dispersion spectra of CeFe_2 Al_10 was computed.
- The neutron inelastic scattering spectrum of CeFe_2 Al_10 was plotted.

	Experimental Particle Physics                                      July. 2018-Aug. 2018
Supervisor: Dr. Teppei Katori (Queen Mary University of London)
Project: Simulation of IceCube beamtest by Geant4. 
- A beam test using a single IceCube optical module was carried out at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility to study whether pulse shape analysis can be used to distinguish between electrons and pions. 
- Based on a beam test study conducted at the Fermilab Test Beam Facility, we set up a water tank and placed a DOM inside the tank in Geant4. We then simulated the response of the PMT due to Cherenkov radiation.
- We adjusted the step size and ran the event by commands or macro files; then, the photons were detected. 

Project: PMT Modification. 
- The PMT from Super-K was broken, and we attempted to fix it. 
- The degradation of the HV cable caused the PMT to malfunction; therefore, the cable needed to be replaced. After the cable was replaced, a pulse could be discovered with two diﬀerent types of noise.
- A new voltage divider circuit and test circuit were built to test if the voltage divider of the PMT was malfunctioning.

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. However, I have found that my interest lies in physics after completing an internship with Dr. Katori. Thus, I decided quit from Shanghai Jiao Tong University and apply for a Ph.D. position in physics. During my days in Shanghai Jiao Tong University this year, I also plan to participate in some research programs and perform well in my computer science and mathematics courses which might be useful in my future physics study.
